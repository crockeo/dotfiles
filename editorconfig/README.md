# editorconfig

These are a set of config files (and a `dotfile.json`, but we'll get to that in
a sec) for one to configure a `tmux`, `zsh`, and `vim`-based editor setup. It is
meant to be installed through my
[dotfile-manager](http://github.com/crockeo/dotfile-manager) but can just as
easily be manually downloaded and moved to the home directory.

### Installation

(It would be a good idea to back up any dotfiles you have for any of these
three programs before you install)

Assuming you have the `dotfile-manager` installed already:

```bash
$ dotfile-manager install crockeo/editorconfig.git
```
